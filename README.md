Game Programming

During my first year at Ostfold University College I took the course "Game Programming", where we used Flash and ActionScript 3.0 to create a game. 
Me and my two group members chose to create a room escape game, and we called it "The Chamber of Secrets". 

To install and read the code of the game you will need Adobe Flash Professional.
